#### Description
The ride sharing bonanza continues! Seeing the success of notable players like Uber and Lyft, you've decided to join a fledgling ride sharing company of your own. In your latest capacity, you'll be acting as Chief Data Strategist for the company. In this role, you'll be expected to offer data-backed guidance on new opportunities for market differentiation.

You've since been given access to the company's complete recordset of rides. This contains information about every active driver and historic ride, including details like city, driver count, individual fares, and city type.

#### Observable Trends

* There is a inverse relationship between the number of rides and the price of the fare. 

* Likewise, the total number of rides is proportionately related to the total fares in urban, rural and suburban cities alike.

* Urban cities have the most rides with the cheapest fare, while suburban cities have the fewest number of rides and the highest fare. One possible explanation for this is that there are more people in population-dense urban cities as opposed to suburban and rural cities; thus, drivers need to lower their prices to compete with other drivers because demand for rides is higher .
